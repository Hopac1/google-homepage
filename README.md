# google-homepage

<!-- Write a brief introduction for what the current project is. -->

This project is a clone of the Google homepage using HTML and CSS. I'm doing this project as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course,
and I hope to level up my ability to look at a design and replicate it in code. The goal is not to implement the same functionality of the Google homepage
into my clone, but visually it will look similar.
