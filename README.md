# google-homepage

[Live demo](https://hopac1.github.io/google-homepage/index.html) ðŸ‘ˆ

<!-- Write a brief introduction for what the current project is. -->

This project is a clone of the Google homepage using HTML and CSS. I'm doing this project as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course,
and I hope to level up my ability to look at a design and replicate it in code. The goal is not to implement the same functionality of the Google homepage
into my clone, but visually it will look similar.

<!-- Write what skills you have demonstrated once you have completed it. -->

The skills I've demonstrated are learning how to structure a HTML document and finding ways to keep my styles.css file clean. In the future I will optimise my websites for use on different devices and screen sizes because as it stands, this web page isn't optimized for anything other than my screen.
